        <h2>About the App</h2>
        <p>
            Keeping in mind the migration of workers due to lack of work in our area, we are starting One Center, whose
            main objective is to increase the availability and transparency of proper work in any area.<br><br>

            Working people are in search of work around their own area, so that they can live with family, but often
            they are not able to do this, because searching from door to door, that too due to their work skills.
            According to it it is very difficult and time is also very wasted. Due to these reasons their daily wages
            are greatly affected and often they are forced to move to other cities, states and even abroad to find some
            basic and permanent work to keep their income stable.<br><br>

            It is also for those people who search for the right resource for their work, which can give them the right
            quality by completing the work on time. But they lack options, they do not know all the resources of their
            area, so that they can choose the right resource according to them, therefore, often they do not get the
            right quality of work even at reasonable cost.<br><br>

            Keeping in mind migration, transparency and better quality of work, we are developing a platform that will
            list all the work or workers within an area of ​​20 km (which can be changed) from the user's preferred
            location, And users will be able to easily select the right resource and job according to their work
            efficiency and utility.<br><br>

            The platform will be very simple and user friendly, users will also be able to get in touch via direct
            message, call or whats app. If they have the basic knowledge of the smartphone, they can easily manage their
            account, otherwise our team will help them with the basic setup, and walk you through the process.
